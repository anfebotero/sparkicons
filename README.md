Sparkicons
==========

From the mind of  Mark Boulton - "Iâ€™m defining a Sparkicon as a small, inline icon with additional link meta data to describe either the content and/or the behaviour when the user clicks the link." - http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/sparkicons

This implementation is solely the excellent work of Andy Davies @andydavies (http://andydavies.me/blog/2013/01/14/implementing-sparkicons/), which I may eventually use a foundation to build upon.
