Sparkicons
==========

From the mind of  Mark Boulton - "Iâ€™m defining a Sparkicon as a small, inline icon with additional link meta data to describe either the content and/or the behaviour when the user clicks the link." - http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/sparkicons

This implementation will take the excellent work of Andy Davies (http://andydavies.me/blog/2013/01/14/implementing-sparkicons/) as a foundation and build upon it
